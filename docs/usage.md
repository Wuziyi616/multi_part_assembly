# Basic Usage

## Training

**Please go throught the `scripts/train.py` file and modify some training configurations according to items marked by `TODO`**, e.g. disable DDP training, handle cluster/slurm-related settings.

See [model](./model.md) for details about the baselines supported in this codebase.

To train a model, simply run:

```
python scripts/train.py --cfg_file $CFG --other_args ...
```

For example, to train the Global baseline model on PartNet chair, replace `$CFG` with `configs/global/global-32x1-cosine_200e-partnet_chair.py`.
Other optional arguments include:

-   `--category`: train the model only on a subset of data, e.g. `Chair`, `Table`, `Lamp` on PartNet
-   `--gpus`: setting training GPUs, note that by default we are using DDP supported by PyTorch-Lightning
-   `--weight`: loading pre-trained weights
-   `--fp16`: FP16 mixed precision training
-   `--cudnn`: setting `cudnn.benchmark = True`
-   `--vis`: visualize assembly results to wandb during training, may take large disk space

### Logging

We use [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site) for logging.
Please set up your account with `wandb login` on the machine before running training commands.

### Helper Scripts

Script for configuring and submitting jobs to cluster SLURM system:

```
GPUS=1 CPUS_PER_GPU=8 MEM_PER_CPU=5 QOS=normal ./scripts/sbatch_run.sh $PARTITION $JOB_NAME ./scripts/train.py --cfg_file $CFG --other_args...
```

Script for running a job multiple times over different random seeds:

```
GPUS=1 CPUS_PER_GPU=8 MEM_PER_CPU=5 QOS=normal REPEAT=$NUM_REPEAT ./scripts/dup_run_sbatch.sh $PARTITION $JOB_NAME ./scripts/train.py $CFG --other_args...
```

We also provide scripts for training on single/all categories of the Breaking-Bad dataset's `everyday` subset.
See [train_everyday_categories.sh](../scripts/train_everyday_categories.sh) and [train_one_category.sh](../scripts/train_one_category.sh).

## Testing

Similar to training, to test a pre-trained weight, simply run:

```
python scripts/test.py --cfg_file $CFG --weight path/to/weight
```

Optional auguments:

-   `--category`: test the model only on a subset of data
-   `--min_num_part` & `--max_num_part`: control the number of pieces we test
-   `--gpus`: setting testing GPUs

If you want to get per-category result of this model (currently only support `everyday` subset of the Breaking-Bad dataset), and report performance averaged over all the categories (used in the paper), run:

```
python scripts/test.py --cfg_file $CFG --weight path/to/weight --category all
```

We will print the metrics on each category and the averaged results.

We also provide script to gather results trained under multiple random seeds. Suppose you train the models per category by running `./scrips/train_everyday_categories.sh $COMMAND $CFG.py`. Then the model checkpoint will be saved in `checkpoint/$CFG-$CATEGORY-dup$X`. To collect the performance on each category, run:

```
python scripts/collect_test.py --cfg_file $CFG.py --num_dup $X --ckp_suffix checkpoint/$CFG-
```

The per-category results will be formatted into latex table style for the ease of paper writing.

Besides, if you train the models on all categories by running `GPUS=1 CPUS_PER_GPU=8 MEM_PER_CPU=5 QOS=normal REPEAT=$NUM_REPEAT ./scripts/dup_run_sbatch.sh $PARTITION $JOB_NAME ./scripts/train.py $CFG --other_args...`. Then the model checkpoint will be saved in `checkpoint/$CFG-dup$X`. To collect the performance, simply adding a `--train_all` flag:

```
python scripts/collect_test.py --cfg_file $CFG.py --num_dup $X --ckp_suffix checkpoint/$CFG- --train_all
```

You can again control the number of pieces and GPUs to use.

## Visualization

To visualize the results produced by trained model, simply run:

```
python scrips/vis.py --cfg_file $CFG --weight path/to/weight --category $CATEGORY --vis $NUM_TO_SAVE
```

It will save the original meshes, input meshes after random transformation and meshes transformed by model predictions, as well as point clouds sampled from them in `path/to/vis` folder (same as the pre-trained weight).
